"""This one is done by observation and with the use of my art program, so I could be completely wrong.
The kittens favourite superhero is 'THE HULK'
Block 2 and block 5 have the same hex colour code/rgb codes (#480000) (R = 72, G=B=0), so those are the same letters.
No other option has a repeating letter aside from 'THE HULK'.
Hence, the answer is C.
